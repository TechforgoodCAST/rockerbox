# Rockerbox

A service to help charities unearth the golden nuggets of wisdom buried deep within their forums.

## Why

Many charities have forums, some of which have existed for 15+ years. These forums are a rich resource of user-generated content however due to their size and often inadequate search functionality, any potentially useful content is extremely hard to find. Rockerbox aims to make unearthing this content easy and intuitive. This would then allow charities to put it to use in new and innovative ways.

## What

Rockerbox will provide an interface for sorting forums' datasets. Search will be an integral part of this, we aim to have functionality to make customisable search queries which provide meaningful and relevant results. The product would then allow users to store useful content in a databank for future use and to discard those results that should not be queried again.
